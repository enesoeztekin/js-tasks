# Task 3: Asian Kitchen's Menu

**Summary:**
I used `fetch()` function to retrieve data from JSON file and `createElement()` function to create DOM elements dynamically in this project. This project's taught me the fundamentals of creating DOM elements dynamically, and how to structure a JSON file, and how to retrieve data from it. I want to thank [Patika.Dev](https://app.patika.dev/courses/javascript/odev3) for this instructive JS Task.
