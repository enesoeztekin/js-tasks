# Task 1: JS Clock

**Summary:**
I took user input via `prompt()` function in this project, and used date functions in js to display time and the day of the week. For the user interface, I only used pure CSS.

**Hint:**
`clamp()` function that I used in CSS file is to make the font-size responsive relative to viewport size. This function takes three arguments. `clamp(min, preferred, max)`
